# Social_Clues

Social Clues is a puzzle-adventure game for children with autism and developmental disabilities that teaches pragmatics and social skills. Players control Pete and Kate Mum as they traverse a stylized, cartoon world to search for their lost toys. Behind the scenes player actions are tracked via key metrics, providing parents and therapists informative data and insight into player progression and behavioral change.

Social Clues was developed for the iPad using Unity3D with NGUI plugin and programmed in C#.
